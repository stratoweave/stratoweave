# Device management

StratoWeave keeps managed devices in the intent tree rather than in a separate
out-of-band inventory. The transform layer immediately above the RFS layer owns
that intent: it decides which devices exist, which generated device type each
device uses, how the orchestrator reaches it, and which RFS transforms should
be created for it.

## Build-time: device adapters come from the system spec

Each supported vendor OS version is declared as a separate device type in the
system specification. Every `DeviceType.from_dir(...)` call loads one specific
directory of YANG modules, and the generated application builds a typed device
adapter for that exact module set.

```acton title="spec/src/sorespo_gen.act"
spec = stratoweave.build.SysSpec("sorespo", [
		cfs_layer,
		rfs_layer,
], [
		stratoweave.build.DeviceType.from_dir(fc, "CiscoIosXr_25_3_1", "yang/CiscoIosXr_25_3_1"),
		stratoweave.build.DeviceType.from_dir(fc, "CiscoIosXr_25_4_1", "yang/CiscoIosXr_25_4_1"),
		stratoweave.build.DeviceType.from_dir(fc, "JuniperCRPD_24_4R1_9", "yang/JuniperCRPD_24_4R1_9"),
])

spec.gen_app(fc, "../src/")
```

When a vendor ships a new release with a different set of YANG modules or
revisions, add a new directory and a new `DeviceType.from_dir(...)` entry, and
rebuild the application. At runtime, the value written into `device.type` must
match one of these device type names exactly.

## Operations-time: device entries are part of intent

Operators do not create `DeviceMgr` instances directly. Instead, they submit
northbound intent, and the layer above RFS emits two related outputs for each
managed device:

- a `device` entry that selects the generated adapter and supplies connection
	details
- an `rfs` entry that carries the resource-facing service data for that same
	device

In a two-layer system this is the CFS transform. In a three-layer system it
would be the intermediate layer.

## Exposing device inputs on the northbound

If device address, credentials, or adapter selection should be operator
provided, those inputs must exist in the northbound YANG model.

```yang title="spec/yang/cfs/netinfra.yang"
...
	container netinfra {
		list router {
			key name;

			sw:transform sorespo.cfs.Router;

			leaf name {
				type string;
			}
			leaf device-type {
				type string;
			}
			leaf mgmt-address {
				type inet:host;
			}
			leaf device-username {
				type string;
			}
			leaf device-password {
				type string;
			}
		}
	}
```

If your northbound model exposes these leaves, operators can provide them in a
startup XML file or over a northbound API such as NETCONF:

```xml title="SORESPO-style northbound intent"
<netinfra xmlns="...">
	<router>
		<name>pe1</name>
		<device-type>CiscoIosXr_25_3_1</device-type>
		<mgmt-address>192.0.2.10</mgmt-address>
		<device-username>netops</device-username>
		<device-password>netops-password</device-password>
	</router>
</netinfra>
```

In other scenarios, the northbound model may not expose these leaves,
and the transform layer above RFS may instead look up the device type and
credentials from an internal database or a secrets manager. In that case,
the northbound intent would only need to provide e.g. the device name,
and the transform would fill in the rest.

## Creating device and RFS entries in the transform

The transform above RFS creates the device entry and the matching RFS subtree
together. The important pattern is:

```acton title="src/sorespo/cfs.act"
class Router(base.Router):
		def transform(self, i, linked, dynstate):
				o = base.o_root()

				dev = o.device.create(i.name)
				dev.type = i.device_type

				oob = dev.address.create("oob")
				oob.address = i.mgmt_address

				dev.credentials.username = i.device_username
				dev.credentials.password = i.device_password

				rfs = o.rfs.create(i.name)
				rfs.base_config.name = i.name

				return o
```

Here, `o.device.create(i.name)` adds the managed device entry consumed by the
generated device layer. `dev.type` selects one of the build-time device types,
for example `CiscoIosXr_25_3_1`. `o.rfs.create(i.name)` creates the RFS object
bound to that same device.

If credentials should not be operator supplied, keep them out of the
northbound YANG and set the same `dev.credentials` fields from an internal
lookup instead.

## SSH transport parameters

Every SSH-based adapter -- NETCONF over SSH today, CLI adapters later -- reads
its transport settings from the device's `ssh` container. Leave it out and the
SSH library's defaults apply; set it to deal with devices that need something
narrower or older.

To expose these settings in another model, import `stratoweave-ssh` and use
its `ssh-client-config` grouping inside an `ssh` container:

```yang
import stratoweave-ssh {
  prefix sw-ssh;
}

container ssh {
  uses sw-ssh:ssh-client-config;
}
```

Include `swyang.ssh` in the layer's models when generating the application,
and copy the settings to `dev.ssh` in its transform.

```acton title="src/sorespo/cfs.act"
dev.ssh.cipher = ["aes128-ctr"]
dev.ssh.key_exchange = ["diffie-hellman-group14-sha256"]
dev.ssh.host_key_algorithm = ["ssh-rsa"]
dev.ssh.minimum_rsa_bits = u64(1024)
```

The algorithm leaf-lists (`cipher`, `mac`, `key-exchange`,
`host-key-algorithm`, `public-key-algorithm`, `compression-algorithm`) are
ordered preference lists, most preferred first, and an empty one means "use the
library default". `host-key-algorithm` is what decides which host key type the
device presents. The remaining leaves are `compression-level` (1-9, default 7),
`rekey-after-bytes`, `rekey-after-seconds` and `minimum-rsa-bits`; absent
`rekey-after-bytes` uses the negotiated cipher's RFC 4344 volume limit, and
absent `rekey-after-seconds` disables time-based rekeying.

Changing the `ssh` container reconnects the device. An algorithm name the SSH
library does not support is rejected by the YANG enumeration; anything that
slips past is logged and leaves the device disconnected rather than retrying a
connection that can never come up.

The northbound NETCONF server has its own equivalent settings, configured as
system settings rather than as intent; see [Running StratoWeave](run.md).

## Device logs

Every device writes its own log file, `devices/<name>.log` in the log
directory; see [Running StratoWeave](run.md#logging). The device logs at the
level of the `log.device.level` setting, unless its `debug/log-level` leaf
sets another level. With `debug/connection` set, the device logs at `trace`
and the file also holds every NETCONF message to and from the device,
configuration data included.

Like the other device settings, both leaves come from the transform that
creates the device entry. To let operators change the level of one device at
run time, expose the leaves in the northbound model and copy them, as the
fleetmgr example does:

```acton title="fleetmgr/src/fleetmgr/cfs.act"
dev.debug.connection = i.debug.connection
dev.debug.log_level = i.debug.log_level
```

A new level applies without a reconnect.

## RFS models still define the service-specific southbound data

The built-in device list already comes from the StratoWeave RFS schema. Your
project-specific RFS YANG augments that schema with the service-specific nodes
that your RFS transforms need.

```yang title="spec/yang/rfs/sorespo-rfs.yang"
module sorespo-rfs {
	...
	augment "/sw-rfs:rfs" {
		container base-config {
			sw:rfs-transform sorespo.rfs.BaseConfig;

			leaf name {
				type string;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

In other words, the layer above RFS creates both the `device` entry and the
matching `rfs` subtree as part of the same overall intent. The generated device
layer then uses the `device` entry to select the correct per-version adapter
and reconcile the rendered configuration against the target device.
